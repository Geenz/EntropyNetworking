# ThreadSanitizer suppressions for EntropyNetworking

# VFS::submit() races: The VirtualFileSystem::submit() function may start executing
# lambdas on worker threads before the submit() call returns to the caller. This causes
# benign races in std::function construction that don't affect correctness but violate
# the C++ memory model. These races would require architectural changes to VFS itself.
#
# Suppressing:
# - Race in VFS::submit() during std::function wrapper construction
# - Race in lambda functor execution while submit() is still constructing the wrapper
